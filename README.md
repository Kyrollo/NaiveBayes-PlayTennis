# Naive Bayes Classifier for PlayTennis Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts for predicting whether to play tennis based on weather conditions using a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Description

The project demonstrates the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the likelihood of playing tennis based on weather attributes such as Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind. It calculates likelihood probabilities for each attribute given the class labels ('Yes' or 'No' for playing tennis) and predicts the probability of playing tennis for new test cases.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Reads and preprocesses the PlayTennis dataset.
- **Naive Bayes Implementation**:
  - Calculates likelihood probabilities for each attribute given the class labels.
  - Predicts the probability of playing tennis based on test attributes.
  
## Usage

To use these scripts, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/NaiveBayes-PlayTennis.git
